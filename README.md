N.E.R: Named Entity Recognition

>> What it does: "Helps extract valuable information from texts by identifying entities like names, dates, and locations." 


>> Examples of named entity recognition (NER) in action:

1. News Article Analysis:
   - Input: "Apple Inc. announced its latest iPhone model in San Francisco on September 12, 2023."
   - Output: 
     - Organizations: Apple Inc.
     - Locations: San Francisco
     - Dates: September 12, 2023
   - Use Case: This can help journalists quickly extract key information from articles for summaries or databases.

2. Customer Support Emails:
   - Input: "I would like to return my order #12345, placed on August 15, 2023, for a refund."
   - Output: 
     - Order ID: #12345
     - Dates: August 15, 2023
   - Use Case: Automating the processing of customer support inquiries by extracting relevant details for ticketing systems.

3. Social Media Monitoring:
   - Input: "Tesla's CEO Elon Musk tweeted about the new Gigafactory in Austin."
   - Output: 
     - Organizations: Tesla
     - People: Elon Musk
     - Locations: Austin
   - Use Case: Businesses can track mentions of their brand or competitors, analyzing sentiment and engagement around key figures and locations.


>> What I've decided: an NER project using a dataset from Hugging Face, spaCy, and Streamlit

>> Topic of NER: Natural disasters from social media
   	- Objective: Analyze dateset for related topics and entities.
	  - Details: In addition to working with the current dataset, scrape data from other sources like news articles or additional social media platforms (Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, etc...) to further refine and enrich your dataset. Apply Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract relevant entities and analyze sentiment trends alongside the occurrence of natural disasters.

>> Steps to Get Started

Step 1: Data Collection  
- Find a relevant dataset for your NER project. You can use the Hugging Face Datasets library to access various datasets suitable for social media analysis.
- Link to the dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/melisekm/natural-disasters-from-social-media

Step 2: Model Selection  
- Choose a suitable NER model. For this project, you will use spaCy as your framework, leveraging its built-in capabilities for named entity recognition.

Step 3: Training/Fine-Tuning  
- Preprocess Data: Clean the dataset by removing URLs, mentions, and special characters, and tokenize the text as needed.
- Fine-Tuning: Load the spaCy pre-trained model and fine-tune it on your selected dataset. Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size to optimize performance.
- Training Setup: Monitor training metrics using tools like TensorBoard, if needed.

Step 4: Evaluation  
- Test your model on a separate dataset to assess its performance. Measure metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Split Data: Divide your dataset into training, validation, and test sets (typically in a 70/20/10 ratio).
- Metrics: Use precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate how effectively your model identifies entities.
- Error Analysis: Review misclassified examples to identify areas for improvement.

Step 5: Deployment  
- Deploy your model as an API or a web application for user interaction.
- API Development: Use frameworks like Flask or FastAPI to create an API that accepts text inputs and returns recognized entities.
- Web Application: Optionally, build a front-end using Streamlit to visualize the results and enhance user experience.

Hereâ€™s a quick guide to help you get started with your project:

Steps to Implement Your NER Project

1. **Dataset from Hugging Face**:
   - Browse the [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets) library and find a suitable NER dataset related to social media.
   - Use the `datasets` library to load the dataset into your environment:
     ```python
     from datasets import load_dataset
     dataset = load_dataset('your_chosen_dataset')
     ```

2. **Setting Up spaCy**:
   - Install spaCy and the required model:
     ```bash
     pip install spacy
     python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm  # or another model if needed
     ```
   - Load the spaCy model in your code:
     ```python
     import spacy
     nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
     ```

3. **Processing Data**:
   - Preprocess the dataset as needed, and run the NER model:
     ```python
     def extract_entities(text):
         doc = nlp(text)
         return [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]
     
     dataset['train'] = dataset['train'].map(lambda x: {'entities': extract_entities(x['text'])})
     ```

4. **Visualizing with Streamlit**:
   - Install Streamlit:
     ```bash
     pip install streamlit
     ```
   - Create a Streamlit app (e.g., `app.py`):
     ```python
     import streamlit as st
     
     st.title("Social Media NER")
     
     text_input = st.text_area("Enter text:")
     if st.button("Analyze"):
         entities = extract_entities(text_input)
         st.write("Detected Entities:")
         for entity in entities:
             st.write(f"{entity[0]}: {entity[1]}")
     ```
   - Run your Streamlit app:
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```

5. **Iterate and Improve**:
   - Test your app, refine your entity extraction logic, and consider adding features like data visualization or feedback mechanisms.
